I pushed the door into the bathroom and everything was neat and tidy.
There was a faint scent of fresh flowers in the room and the exhaust fan was running quietly. There were even a few fresh egg flowers on the vanity.
It was so nice that I could have done yoga here - if there hadn't been a camera pointed at the vanity.
If there were no cameras, I wouldn't mind doing some other exercise.
Even if it's a security measure, there's no need to do it in the toilet ......
The washroom door was closed and I tentatively knocked twice with my knuckles when Liang's yell came from inside.
Someone!
Excuse me.
I think I'm overthinking it, let's go back and talk to Ryang Soo about the map.
It's better here in peace.
Napoleon and Moser went straight to the kitchen as soon as they entered the house. No wonder it is said that the kitchen is not only a battlefield for the cook, but a safe house away from the uncertainty of the world.
As chaotic as the world is, you still have to eat.
I borrowed the dining room, passed by Zhang Hui and Blake who were discussing feverishly, and stepped through a glass sliding door into the kitchen.
I wonder if it's still too late to tell Napoleon and the others ......
Although we had arrived on Spirit Dragon Island, it didn't seem quite like what we had imagined.
Not even close!
Blake's face turned red and his fists clenched.
I thought I'd be able to at least let loose for a meal of meat on the island, but I didn't see anything ......
Meat?
Oh yes, Zhang Hui had said that Blake didn't eat meat. But what he just said was that he wanted to let loose and eat a meal of meat ......
That means it's not that he doesn't want to eat meat, but he can't ......
...... none of your business.
Meat? Isn't that what Moser and Napoleon are doing in the kitchen ......
You don't know anything about it, don't ask.
Speaking of which, have you always been so curious? Just been asking why I'm here even on the boat.
I was just trying to find something to talk about ...... After all, we all have to spend time together on the island in the next few days.
Blake sighed and looked up at me.
If I was going to explain why I was on the island, I couldn't get around something that I really didn't want to bring up.
So if you're looking for something to say, let's change the subject.
I heard Zhang Hui mention something about you earlier ......
What?
I think he said you don't eat meat?
That's not something that guy would say out loud .......
Yes, I don't eat meat. As for the reason, I don't want to mention it.
What about your dinner?
Blake reluctantly pulled a plastic box out from under the table.
Don't mind me, I've brought my own food.
Looks like instant rice?
Something like that.
I took the plastic box, and looking at the packaging alone, it looked like regular instant rice - except it had the words 'low protein rice' printed on it.
Give it back when you've seen enough, I didn't bring much.
Blake snatched the plastic box from my hand and gave me a wary glance.
Are you here to study in Asahi? You don't look like you're from here.
My family moved to Asahi Castle a long time ago, so I went to school here too.
First middle school? Or is it Asahijo Experimental High School ......
I'm in my junior year at Asahijo Medical School! Big! Third!
If dragons really had dragon power like in the legends, I would probably be shaken back several meters by his aura.
I'm just a little late developing ...... When I grow up, I'm sure I won't lose out to you guys.
Uh ...... sorry sorry sorry.
Like he was showing off, Blake stretched out his wings and flapped them in front of me.
Now he's hanging out at Rising City Medical School.
...... It's pretty impressive to have gotten in there.
But now on the island, there's no equipment, and I can only do basic first aid ......
I can only do basic first aid, like the Heimlich maneuver and artificial respiration. But you should know that too, right?
My last name is Heimlich, don't you think?
You can't really be Dr. Heimlich ......
No way.
...... That's okay.
By the way, I think I saw a first aid kit in the storeroom, it might be of some use to you.
Is that right? I'll go check it out later.
I went into the living room, where Ryang Soo was alone on the sofa, sorting out his sketches. The sun was about to set outside the window, casting a golden glow on the glass coffee table and white walls of the living room.
Where is Liang Sir? He hasn't gone back to the ship, has he?
Ryosoo pointed the sharp corner of the folder with the manuscript paper in it towards the closed bathroom door.
He's gone to the bathroom and hasn't come out yet.
That's good, I thought he had quietly sailed away.
No way, right? Why would he do that? Besides the boat had hit a reef and hadn't been repaired.
I couldn't say ...... never mind, maybe I was being paranoid.
I'd better leave Liang Xiu alone with Liang for a while, I couldn't intervene.
The large floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room had the garden outside, which was more to my liking when viewed from the air-conditioned room.
I sat down next to Liang Xiu and Liang and crossed my legs on the sofa.
Liang Soo clutches his sketchbook and waits patiently for Liang to recall what he saw on the island at a word-a-minute pace.
Let me think.
Just take your time and tell me what the island has to offer.
The pier.
Too bad the boat didn't stop at the pier. Anything else?
The house and the garden.
What about the other ones at ......? The ones I haven't had a chance to visit yet.
There's a beach, and a spa.
We can go swimming first, then soak in the spa!
If you soak in the water too long, your skin will wrinkle ......
And where is the highest place on the island? Preferably the kind where you can see the whole island.
The hot springs are at the top of the volcano, I think it's there.
Will it erupt?
Not really ......
So ...... are we stuck on the island now?
It's only three days, I think.
Why did it take three days for the boat to come!
Didn't you, you guys get invited over, I heard from the company that the island owner said that no matter what happens in those three days, no boat can be sent over. We were going to ask why that was necessary, but he said {w=0.5}{nw}
It was his secret and promised to give us three times the boat fare, so ...... we didn't ask any further. Anyway, nothing particularly urgent happens on this island, the volcano hardly ever erupts and {w=0.5}{nw}
there aren't any stinging jellyfish. Probably wouldn't be anything that would necessitate sending a boat over, so agreed ......
Sounds more and more suspicious ...... It wouldn't be so bad to not let a boat be sent if you just didn't want to be bothered.
Liang shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.
Did you originally have any plans for these three days?
Go back to the Asahi docks and stand by.
I thought we weren't allowed to send a boat?
You still have to be ready if you're not allowed to come.
Why ......
I'm only taking this one route.
Liang cocked his head.
And rich people get ideas fast.
So the boat that was sent to pick us up took three days to arrive because you, who were supposed to be on standby at the docks, were stuck here too?
There are other reasons too.
That's fine then ...... you don't have any other arrangements anyway.
By the way, I said earlier that we could squeeze into a bed if there weren't enough beds. I'm serious.
...... Hmm.
I'm still curious, did you really not see the reef then?
Of course not.
He paused and added.
How could it be called a reef if it could be seen.
Then how did you know we were going to hit it?
Shipboard radar.
Radar can scan it, so why not turn a corner ......
The reef was too big to avoid.
Liang gave me a stare.
I wasn't going to crash the ship on purpose.
We're kind of stuck on this island now.
We're supposed to be on holiday, so what are we afraid of~
Besides, didn't Sir Liang say that the boat would be here in a few days when I finish painting the portrait of the island owner? It doesn't matter how many days we stay.
It seems so, but ......
If someone is drowning they should still be sent back to Asahi City for first aid!
Just don't drown!
And we still have you, the Shark Dragon lifeguards must be very reliable.
That's true. ...... Thanks for the compliment.
If the Island Master never shows up, your plan to paint his portrait will be a bust ......
How could that be, he paid me a lot of money to come here. I'm sure he won't let me make a trip for nothing.
But even if he doesn't come, I can still paint the landscape of the island and give you guys some small portraits, so it's not a bad trip.
In any case, it's still strange that the owner of the island who brought us together hasn't shown up by now.
Presumably the rich and powerful are all a bit eccentric, right?
Well, I hope this rich man's eccentricities don't endanger our lives.
Speaking of which, I'm a bit curious, how much did the island master offer you?
He gave me a reason I couldn't refuse ......
I hope it's not what I think it is.
Two thousand dollars more for a full painting set.
Quite a bit cheaper than I thought ...... Just buying you a month of night market barbecues is enough?
I never thought I'd meet a guy who likes to use night market barbecue as a unit of measurement here too, we're so related.
It's because I didn't get to eat it more often when I was still your age that I subconsciously thought that, I guess ......
It just so happens that Moser is the one who runs the barbecue stall, so we can eat liberally for the next two days.
If we're not tired of eating by the time we get back, let's go to his stall for a date?
I should have just gotten paid by that time, no problem!
Seems to be a master of keeping money just like me.
Why do you suddenly want to draw a map of the island?
When I want to draw something, I can't really find a reason myself.
I just suddenly wanted to draw it and did it.
Isn't that what all creative work is like? You don't need a particular reason, just an idea and you can start doing it.
What about when the owner of ...... asks you to paint a portrait?
That one is making money, it doesn't count as creative work.
I just took the drawings you gave me and went around the villa.
How was it, was the structural drawing I gave you accurate?
It's quite accurate, you can figure out the structure of the house just after you've entered it, as expected of an art student.
Although it seems to have subtly stolen the job from the architecture department ......
By the way, isn't the islander in the house?
Searched around and didn't see it anywhere.
How could this be ...... He paid me to draw him, so he couldn't have temporarily stopped wanting it, could he?
I don't feel right, but I can't say why.
Probably hungry?
Ryosu's stomach growled in response.
...... Why don't we go to the restaurant and wait for dinner to start?
I agree.
Ryo-soo put away the sketches spread out on the table and walked with me towards the dining room.
This seemed to be a storage room.
I opened the storage cabinets on either side, which were built from the ground to the ceiling, and took a look.
On top of the cabinets were cameras that could capture the entire storage room.
The owner is probably obsessed with the security of the villa, otherwise there wouldn't be cameras everywhere.
In one cupboard was emergency food, a first aid kit and fresh water, as well as a desalination unit ...... It seems that the islander is a survivalist.
Another contained all sorts of tools, from shovels to fishing rods and even seeds.
Is this ......?
I opened a cabinet filled with boxes of condoms and other sex toys.
The dates were still very new ......
It seems our islanders are more than just survival freaks.
As long as this pantry is there, we won't have to worry about starving to death on the island.
Of course, how well we eat is another story.
Having just gone inside to rest my feet, I didn't want to run out again.
Although the garden was quite beautiful, I preferred to find a place to sit and enjoy it.
